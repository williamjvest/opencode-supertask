# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Ported the plugin to OpenCode 2's `Plugin.define`, session context hook, and tool transform APIs.
- The Worker now passes variants as `provider/model#variant`, and the Dashboard reads project-scoped Agent/model catalogs through the OpenCode 2 client.
- Fixed bundled `supertask gateway` startup so the CLI and `import.meta.main` paths cannot start two Gateway instances.
- Made the asynchronous settlement failure test wait for settlement to begin instead of racing worker shutdown.

All notable user-facing changes are recorded here. This project follows semantic versioning while it is in the `0.x` development series.

## [0.1.41] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Release gates now cover source and test typechecking, lint, coverage, Chromium interaction smoke, native macOS verification, minimum-Bun representative tests, and isolated installation of the packed npm artifact; the MIT license text is included in the package.

### Fixed

- Worker task selection and the `running` transition are now one immediate transaction, preventing concurrent edits from changing a claimed task or bypassing batch serialization.
- Lowering an exhausted retry budget now recursively closes blocked dependents in the same transaction.
- Dashboard requests now require a loopback Host, and PM2/systemd diagnostics run asynchronously in a bounded helper process instead of blocking the Gateway event loop.
- Transient run-settlement failures retain ownership and the known exit outcome, retry quickly and then at a low frequency while the Gateway remains alive, and hand the run to Watchdog only during shutdown.
- OS process inspection remains bounded on Bun 1.1.45, fails closed on timeout or output overflow, and cleans up its managed Unix process group without leaking descendants or risking reused process-group IDs.
- npm releases now install-test and publish the exact same retained tarball instead of repacking after verification.

## [0.1.40] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Tasks and scheduled templates now accept an optional OpenCode model `variant` through plugin tools, CLI commands, smoke diagnostics, and the Dashboard; Workers pass it as `--variant` and snapshot it in every run.
- The Dashboard now reads `opencode models --verbose` and offers only the variants declared by the selected model while preserving historical custom values.

[0.1.40]: https://github.com/vbgate/opencode-supertask/compare/v0.1.39...v0.1.40

## [0.1.39] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- `supertask upgrade` now exits without reinstalling or restarting when the CLI, effective plugin configuration, plugin cache, and ready PM2 Gateway already match npm `latest`.
- Added `supertask upgrade --force` for intentionally reinstalling the current version, refreshing the Gateway environment, and restarting PM2.
- The OpenCode `supertask_upgrade` tool now reports an up-to-date no-op instead of restarting an already converged Gateway.

[0.1.39]: https://github.com/vbgate/opencode-supertask/compare/v0.1.38...v0.1.39

## [0.1.38] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- `supertask doctor` now reads large resolved OpenCode configurations through a private temporary file, avoiding truncated JSON when OpenCode exits before a captured stdout pipe is fully drained.
- Successful runs no longer label truncated or unstructured JSONL fragments as failure reasons in task details and execution logs.

[0.1.38]: https://github.com/vbgate/opencode-supertask/compare/v0.1.37...v0.1.38

## [0.1.37] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Gateway-managed OpenCode runs now set `PWD` to the task working directory, preventing OpenCode server errors when PM2's saved `PWD` differs from the task's `cwd`.

[0.1.37]: https://github.com/vbgate/opencode-supertask/compare/v0.1.36...v0.1.37

## [0.1.36] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- `supertask doctor --smoke` now queues a real Gateway-managed OpenCode task and verifies its exact response. Agent, model, project directory, and timeout are selectable; ordinary `doctor` remains free of model calls.
- Task, scheduled-task, and run details now open as labeled, human-readable summaries. Raw JSON remains available in a collapsed troubleshooting section and can still be copied.

### Fixed

- PM2 install, upgrade, and stale-Gateway replacement now execute `opencode --version` using the exact target Gateway environment before stopping the old process. A broken saved `PATH`, executable, or cwd fails closed without disrupting the working Gateway.
- `supertask doctor` now diagnoses terminal OpenCode and PM2/Gateway OpenCode separately, preventing a successful interactive shell check from hiding a broken daemon environment.
- Execution logs now expand directly beneath the run that was clicked instead of appearing at the bottom of the page.

[0.1.36]: https://github.com/vbgate/opencode-supertask/compare/v0.1.35...v0.1.36

## [0.1.35] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Task and scheduled-task forms now include a server-side project folder browser. After a project is selected, the Dashboard runs that project's local `opencode agent list` and `opencode models` commands and exposes only directly runnable Agents plus the models actually available on the machine.
- Retry delays, run timeouts, and recurring intervals now use common human-readable presets. Number-and-unit input is shown only after choosing “Custom”; one-time schedules continue to use a local date/time picker.
- New Worker runs record the exact executable, argument array, and working directory. Execution Logs present the reproducible shell command, model text, failure diagnostics, and tool activity while retaining the complete raw OpenCode JSONL.

### Fixed

- The model selector now explains that “default” follows the selected Agent/OpenCode configuration and does not pass `-m`, and splits large model catalogs into provider and model selectors.
- OpenCode subagents are no longer offered as direct `opencode run --agent` choices, avoiding silent fallback to a default primary Agent. Existing task values remain editable for compatibility.

[0.1.35]: https://github.com/vbgate/opencode-supertask/compare/v0.1.34...v0.1.35

## [0.1.34] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Explicit `supertask install` and `supertask upgrade` now refresh the Gateway's OpenCode, XDG, and model-provider execution environment from the invoking terminal. PM2 identity, Bun, `HOME`, `PATH`, all `SUPERTASK_*` scope, database/config paths, and the complete rollback runtime remain pinned.
- Failed Worker runs now record the effective Agent, model source, and working directory next to the OpenCode exit code, making terminal-vs-Gateway differences diagnosable.
- `supertask doctor` now fails when the global CLI, exact OpenCode plugin, PM2 Gateway package, and ready-lock versions do not all match.

### Added

- CLI help and interactive `doctor` / database summaries support `auto`, `zh-CN`, and `en` through `--lang` or `SUPERTASK_LANG`.
- Upgrade now detects whether the installed global CLI came from npm or Bun and synchronizes it to the same exact version after the plugin and Gateway are ready.
- README and operations guidance now cover custom primary Agent troubleshooting and execution-environment refresh behavior in both user languages.

### Compatibility

- JSON field names and raw backend diagnostic errors are unchanged; language selection only affects human-facing help and summaries.

## [0.1.33] - 2026-07-18

This release contains the full 0.1.32 change set plus a deterministic database-restore concurrency regression test. It is the stable upgrade target after 0.1.31.

### Fixed

- Pinned plugin installation and Gateway launch to one exact npm version, rejecting stale floating `@latest` / `@next` cache entries and invalid file-as-directory working paths.
- Recorded and validated task working directories before queueing so Gateway-launched OpenCode runs execute in the submitting project.
- Hardened launcher/Worker IPC with a per-run guardian token and bidirectional drain proof; unknown or still-live managed process groups remain quarantined instead of being settled or retried unsafely.
- Made database clear/restore backup-first, transactional, WAL-consistent, schema-compatible across expand-only N/N-1 releases, and safe against concurrent successful writes.
- Hardened PM2 replacement, rollback, lifecycle locking, kill timeouts, macOS restart supervision, and Bun 1.1.45 IPC compatibility.

### Added

- Project-directory grouping, project statistics, task creation/editing, priority/model controls, and project running-state visibility in the Web Dashboard.
- Web creation/editing for cron, delayed, and recurring tasks; “Run now” always creates a normal queued task and waits behind the global concurrency limit.
- PM2-backed “save and restart” configuration flow, light/dark/system themes, Chinese/English Web UI, and mobile layout.
- Global same-`batchId` serialization across projects and Gateway restarts, while independent batches can execute concurrently.
- Safe task deletion, dependency-aware retry, legacy quarantined-run recovery tooling, and stronger end-to-end diagnostics.
